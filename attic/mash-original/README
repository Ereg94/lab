How to use solr admin config:
- Go to ip:port/admin/mashapp/solrhandlerconfig/ . If you don't see any objects, then go
  to /app/search and run a query. That generates a default Mashup object (which
  is the old API configuration object) and a default SolrHandlerConfig object
  (which is what you want to configure) and attaches the SolrHandlerConfig object
  to the Mashup object. You can do all this yourself obviously, but running a query
  on the frontend is easier.


See misc/solr/README for solr directory structure


** Follow this procedure to install django-voting:
	Google Code recommends doing the Subversion checkout like so::
	    svn checkout http://django-voting.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-voting
	
	But the hyphen in the application name can cause issues installing
	into a DB, so it's really better to do this::
	    svn checkout http://django-voting.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ voting

	As per http://code.google.com/p/django-voting/source/browse/trunk/INSTALL.txt ,
		To install it, run the following command inside this directory (trunk):
	
	    python setup.py install
	    
    
** Follow this procedure to install pinax:
    
    As explained in http://pinaxproject.com/docs/trunk/install.html :
    make sure you have the latest versions installed of: Subversion, Git, 
    Mercurial and Bazaar
    
    curl -o pinax-boot.py http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/trunk/scripts/pinax-boot.py
    python pinax-boot.py pinax-env
    source bin/activate
    pip install --requirement src/pinax/requirements/external_apps.txt

	
	Now move the directory where you have the git clone of the project and put 
	it in pinax-env/ , so you'll get pinax-env/mashup/
	The directory can go anywhere, but currently PINAX_ROOT in settings.py is 
	set up relative to pinax-env/
	Then create a symlink for ~/mashup (this is necessary for solr):
	  ln -s (.....)pinax-env/mashup ~/mashup
	
	Important Note: You need to be in the pinax-env everytime before trying
	  to python manage.py. To get in the pinax-env, run this command:
	  source bin/activate
	  
	  If you don't, you'll get errors about modules not found.
	Note: The python-boot.py script installs Django (1.02) for the pinax-env.

	
	
How to update django-monetize app (if ever needed):
  It's possible to follow instructions from http://github.com/lethain/django-monetize/blob/9868c15fa1b4366840f41d64ccbac267aa79e691/README
  but that makes it an issue to install in every server. 
  So I just added the whole app to our repo. Nice and simple.
  If you want to update, you need to clone the repo: http://github.com/lethain/django-monetize/tree/master
    git clone git://github.com/lethain/django-monetize.git
  The repo contains this structure:
  django-monetize/
    django_monetize/
    monetize_project/
  Copy django-monetize/django_monetize into mashup/apps (override the directory there)

  Earn money!
