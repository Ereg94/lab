Django standard filters: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/#filters

Our own filters are in .py files in templatetags. They have comments on what they do.


Convention: HTML file fragments (files that are {% include %}'ed by other
  files) have a leading underscore, as in _twitter_results.html (which
  is included by results.html)



To use media: CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
--------------------------------------------
Place the media in folder mashup/media and then reference it inside
the HTML by this path: /site_media/

Example: mashup/media/javascript/mycode.js
becomes: <script type="text/javascript" src="/site_media/javascript/mycode.js"
